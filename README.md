MLHproject
Martian Feast Our project is made using HTML, CSS, JS , Tailwindcss , Django and Python, hence It is a website for restaraunt menu to produce more 
profits as it would reduce the need or waiters and promote self services...this would also help in better management and analysis of proftis and records of 
losses. So when you reach a table you can scan a qr code and your table number along with your order would be added to admins or cooks user interface
and when ever the order is ready you will receive a sms notifications which would be provided through api and you can also track the status whether 
the cook has acccepted your order.
